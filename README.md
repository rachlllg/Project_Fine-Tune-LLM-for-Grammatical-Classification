# Project_Fine-Tune-LLM-for-Grammatical-Classification
Fine tuned RoBERTa using Tensorflow on the CoLA dataset to create a grammatical acceptability classifier. Experimented with different hyperparameters and achieved results on par with the original published paper. All data cleaning, analysis, and model building were conducted using the Python programming language.
